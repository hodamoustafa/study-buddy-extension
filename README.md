## Inspiration
After going online, my group and I found it difficult to contact other class members in order to study together or clear topics up. By creating this extension, it will enable us to better communicate with other members of a certain class and set up study sessions
## What it does
The extension allows the user to view the topics discussed in a certain class, and to see other students who also expressed interest in that particular respective topic. It also allows the user to schedule a meeting by providing their contact information, the topic they would like to study, and the date/location of that meeting. Once registering for a meeting, the user has the ability to view other meetings scheduled and its respective information. 
## How we built it
We first started with a basic template for a chrome extension, and then edited the HTML files to display the information and choices we wanted. We also added CSS files in order to customize the extension view.
## Challenges we ran into
We had difficulty deciding how to display the topics and the users for each topic, and essentially decided on a menu where the user can select the topic that they are interested in. We also had issues in deciding what considers a user to be "online" and how to display that information. We decided in the end that a user can decide whether other members are online and studying by checking out the other meetings registered by users in that class and checking the time duration for each meeting.  
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of managing to display the information we wanted in a clean and organized fashion. Not all members of the group are that experienced in frontend development, so it was an accomplishment to learn new things about HTML and CSS.  
## What we learned
We learnt more about extensions and how they interact with the browser. 
## What's next for Study Buddy Extension
Since we did not have a lot of time to fully implement everything we wanted, we hope in the future that we can add more classes for the user to choose from (instead of the default sample class added in the demo), and to refine the display more. Ideally, we would implement backend to store information like list of students interested in such a topic, along with profile information.
